I have been a developer here for many years now and I have worked on the website during this time. We started to make the site using Laravel which is a PHP Framework. Now we have changed to use Laravel as the backend of the site and use Next.JS for the frontend. The radio panel for staff has also been made using Laravel and allows staff to read requests when live on the station, add banners, manage users, etc....",

This app targets IOS and Android and includes features such as the player, show timetable and a requests form. Unfortunately, this app has been taken down however, plans are to get it back up in the future!",

I am solving this by making the tracker in c++ and utilising many libraries like CURL, SteamworksSDK, SCS SDK, etc... to solve this.",
